#' Overlap of ellipsoid-based ecological niche models
#'
#' @description ellipsoid_overlap performs analyses to measure the degree of
#' overlap between two or more ellipsoid-based ecological niches as in pairwise
#' comparisons. Measures can be done considering the entire ellipsoid volume or
#' sets of environmental conditions (background).
#'
#' @param ... data_overlap objects containing data for individual niches to be
#' compared in overlap analyses. At least two data_overlap objects are needed
#' to perform analyses. These objects can be created with the function
#' \code{\link{overlap_object}}.
#' @param overlap_type (character) type of overlap to be measured. Options are:
#' "all", "full", and "back_union". Default = "all". See details.
#' @param n_points (character) number of random points to be generated for
#' performing Monte-Carlo simulations for full overlap-type measurements.
#' Default = 1000000.
#' @param significance_test (logical) whether or not to perform a test to determine
#' statistical significance of overlap results. See details; default = FALSE.
#' @param iterations (numeric) number of iterations to be performed during the
#' significance test; default = 1000.
#' @param confidence_limit (numeric) confidence limit for the significance test.
#' Default = 0.05
#'
#' @return
#' An object of class \code{\link{overlap_ellipsoid}} containing all results
#' from overlap analyses as well as other information needed for plotting.
#'
#' @usage
#' ellipsoid_overlap(..., overlap_type = "all", n_points = 1000000,
#'                   significance_test = FALSE, iterations = 1000,
#'                   confidence_limit = 0.05)
#'
#' @details
#' Types of overlap are as follows:
#' - "all", performs all types of overlap analyses allowed.
#' - "full", measures overlap of the complete volume of the ellipsoidal niches.
#' - "back_union", measures overlap of ellipsoidal niches considering only the
#' union of the environmental conditions relevant for the two species (backgrounds).
#'
#' The statistical significance test consist in randomly sampling the background
#' with n = to the number of records of each species and creating ellipsoids with
#' such data. Overlap is measured for each pair of random-ellipsoids according to
#' the \code{overlap_type} selected. The process is repeated \code{replicate}
#' times and the observed overlap value is compared to the values found for
#' pairs of random-ellipsoids. The null hypothesis is that the niches are
#' overlapped and if the observed values are as extreme or more extreme than the
#' lower limit of the values found for the random-ellipsoids, the null hypothesis
#' is rejected. This is, if the observed overlap value is lower than the 95%
#' (or the value defined in \code{confidence_limit}) of the random-derived values
#' of overlap, the niches are considered not-overlapped. If the observed value
#' cannot be distinguished from random, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
#' A p-value and the pre-defined \code{confidence_limit} will be added to the
#' overlap matrix when the test is performed. A list with all the overlap results
#' from the analyses with random-ellipsoids will be added to the
#' \code{\link{overlap_ellipsoid}} object returned.
