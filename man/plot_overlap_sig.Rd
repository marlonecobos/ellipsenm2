\arguments{
\item{object}{overlap_ellipsoid object resulted from using the function
\code{\link{ellipsoid_overlap}}.}

\item{niches}{(numeric) pair of integer numbers denoting the niches for
which results will be plotted. Default = c(1, 2).}

\item{main}{(character) plot main title, default = "".}

\item{xlab}{(character) label of x axis, default = "Overlap".}

\item{ylab}{(character) label of y axis, default = "Frequency".}

\item{breaks}{type of breaks as in \code{\link[graphics]{hist}}, default = 30.}

\item{bar_col}{color of histogram bars, default = "gray65".}

\item{cl_col}{color of confidence limit line, default = "black".}

\item{observed_col}{color of line representing observed value of overlap,
default = "blue".}

\item{cl_lty}{type of line for confidence limit, default = 2.}

\item{observed_lty}{type of line for observed value of overlap, default = 1.}

\item{cl_lwd}{thickness of line for confidence limit, default = 2.}

\item{observed_lwd}{thickness of line for observed value of overlap,
default = 2.}

\item{xlim}{limits of x axis, the default, NULL, derives limits from data.}
}
\value{
A plot with results from tests of statistical significance.

\description{
plot_overlap_sig helps to create a plot to interpret results
from statistical significance tests in overlap analyses.
