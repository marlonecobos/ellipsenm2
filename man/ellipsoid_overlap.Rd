\item{...}{data_overlap objects containing data for individual niches to be
compared in overlap analyses. At least two data_overlap objects are needed
to perform analyses. These objects can be created with the function

"all", "full", and "back_union". Default = "all". See details.}

\item{n_points}{(character) number of random points to be generated for
performing Monte-Carlo simulations for full overlap-type measurements.

\item{significance_test}{(logical) whether or not to perform a test to determine
statistical significance of overlap results. See details; default = FALSE.}

\value{
An object of class \code{\link{overlap_ellipsoid}} containing all results
from overlap analyses as well as other information needed for plotting.

\description{
ellipsoid_overlap performs analyses to measure the degree of
overlap between two or more ellipsoid-based ecological niches as in pairwise
comparisons. Measures can be done considering the entire ellipsoid volume or
sets of environmental conditions (background).
}
\details{
Types of overlap are as follows:
\itemize{
\item "all", performs all types of overlap analyses allowed.
\item "full", measures overlap of the complete volume of the ellipsoidal niches.
\item "back_union", measures overlap of ellipsoidal niches considering only the
union of the environmental conditions relevant for the two species (backgrounds).
}

The statistical significance test consist in randomly sampling the background
with n = to the number of records of each species and creating ellipsoids with
such data. Overlap is measured for each pair of random-ellipsoids according to
the \code{overlap_type} selected. The process is repeated \code{replicate}
times and the observed overlap value is compared to the values found for
pairs of random-ellipsoids. The null hypothesis is that the niches are
overlapped and if the observed values are as extreme or more extreme than the
lower limit of the values found for the random-ellipsoids, the null hypothesis
is rejected. This is, if the observed overlap value is lower than the 95\%
(or the value defined in \code{confidence_limit}) of the random-derived values
of overlap, the niches are considered not-overlapped. If the observed value
cannot be distinguished from random, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
A p-value and the pre-defined \code{confidence_limit} will be added to the
overlap matrix when the test is performed. A list with all the overlap results
from the analyses with random-ellipsoids will be added to the
\code{\link{overlap_ellipsoid}} object returned.
