\title{Fit moment-based minimum volumen ellipsoids}
\usage{
mbased_mve(data, fitting_tolerance = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix of values to be used for fitting the ellipsoid. Columns
represent dimensions and rows observations.}

\item{fitting_tolerance}{(numeric) proportion of error allowed when checking
if the ellipsoid incloses all values considered to fit it. Default = 0.001.}
}
\value{
A named list containing the values for the centroid of th ellipsoid and a
matrix of covariance.
}
\description{
mbased_mve helps in finding the centroid and matrix that
define a minimum volume ellipsoid as proposed by Moshtagh (2005).
}
\details{
The algorithm used to fit the ellipsoids here was implemented by
Moshtagh (2005) and based on initial work of Khachiyan (1996) and
Rocha et al. (2002).
