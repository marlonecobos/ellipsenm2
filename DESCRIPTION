Description: A collection of tools to characterize ecological niches using 
    ellipsoid envelopes. Functions to perform model calibration and selection, 
    prepare model projections to distinct scenarios, assess niche overlap, and
    produce virtual ecological niches are included as part of this package. 
    Other functions implemented here are useful to perform a series of common
    pre- and post-modeling analyses. In contrast to other tools for ecological
    niche and species distribution modeling, this package is the first in 
    presenting a comprehensive set of tools that use ellipsoid envelopes as 
    the theoretical representation of ecological niches. Details on the 
    theoretical background and methods used here can be found in:
